## Audition Rounds

Random excerpt generator for mock auditions, currently based on the September 2023 audition list for the U.S. Army Band "Pershing's Own".

This will print one page of excerpts per round with the idea being that the first time you see the list is right when you sit down at the stand. Works well if you have a partner to quickly take the excerpts away from the printer and flip them over so you can't see them.

## How to use

I've been running this in the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Powershell Prompt on Windows 10, but I'm sure there are other ways to do it.

1. ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/jpwogaman/audition-rounds.git
    ```

2. ```
    cd audition-rounds    
    ```

3. ```py 
    python audition_rounds.py
    ```
